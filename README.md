# Mitch Falling Man

## Overview

**Mitch Falling Man** is a project aimed at detecting potential falls using a wearable device, the Mitch bracelet, and subsequently sending alerts. The system leverages Mosquitto for MQTT messaging and Node-RED for processing and visualizing the data. This project is still in development, with the fall detection algorithm and alert communication yet to be implemented.

## Features

- **BLE Connectivity**: Connects to the Mitch bracelet via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
- **MQTT Communication**: Utilizes Mosquitto as the MQTT broker to publish data from the Mitch bracelet.
- **Data Processing**: Filters and processes accelerometer data from the Mitch bracelet.
- **Node-RED Integration**: Sends data to Node-RED for further processing and visualization.

## Project Structure

### `mitch_connection.py`

This script handles the connection to the Mitch bracelet, reads and processes data, and publishes it to an MQTT broker. Below is a brief description of the script's key components:

- **BLE Connection**: 
  - `connect_to_device(address)`: Manages the connection to the Mitch bracelet.
  - `configure_accelerometer()`: Configures the sensitivity parameters of the bracelet's accelerometer.
  
- **Data Processing**: 
  - `process_raw_data(raw_data)`: Converts raw data from the bracelet into x, y, z coordinates.
  - `filter_data(x, y, z)`: Applies a filter to smooth out the accelerometer data.
  - `read_device_data()`: Reads and processes data from the bracelet.

- **MQTT Communication**: 
  - `start_mqtt_client()`: Initializes the MQTT client and connects to the broker.
  - `stop_mqtt_client()`: Stops the MQTT client.
  - `publish_data(topic, payload)`: Publishes the processed data to a specified MQTT topic.

- **Signal Handling**: 
  - `signal_handler(sig, frame)`: Handles interrupt signals (e.g., `Ctrl+C`) to safely stop the program.

### Future Work

- **Fall Detection Algorithm**: Develop and implement an algorithm to detect falls based on accelerometer data.
- **Alert System**: Define the method for sending alerts (e.g., SMS, email) in case a fall is detected.

## Installation

To get started with the Mitch Falling Man project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mitch_Falling_Man.git
    cd Mitch_Falling_Man
    ```

2. **Set Up the Python Environment**:
    - Create and activate a virtual environment:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
      ```
    - Install the required dependencies:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

3. **Configure Mosquitto**:
    - Install Mosquitto if not already installed:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
      ```
    - Start the Mosquitto broker:
      ```bash
      mosquitto
      ```

4. **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    python mitch_connection.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Connect Mitch Bracelet**: Ensure the Mitch bracelet is turned on and in range for BLE connection.
2. **Monitor Data**: Use Node-RED to visualize and analyze the data received via MQTT.
3. **Future Enhancements**: Implement the fall detection algorithm and the communication system for alerts.
